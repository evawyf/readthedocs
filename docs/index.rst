Welcome to TensorFlow Model Garden's (TFMG) documentation!
================================

The goal of the TFMG is to develop exemplary implementations of prominent machine learning models in community. This documentation is to explain a process for reproducing a state-of-the-art machine learning model at a level of quality suitable for inclusion in the TFMG, which includes the engineering process and elaborate on each step, from paper analysis to model release.
