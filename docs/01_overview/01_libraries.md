# Modeling Libraries

We provide standardized SoTA modeling libraries (TF-NLP, TF-Vision)

## TF-NLP for Natural Language Processing

TF-NLP is a modeling library for natural language processing using best practices in TensorFLow 2. We. It provides a collection of state-of-the-art, reproducible, extensible, and scalable natural language models, as well as reusable modeling components and libraries.

## TF-Vision for Computer Vision

TF-Vision is a modeling library for computer vision natively designed in Tensorflow 2. It provides a wide range of state-of-the-art computer vision models, flexible design for easy extension, and end-to-end pipeline to accomplish tasks in computer vision benchmarks.
