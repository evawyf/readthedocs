# Learn about Configs

In order to configure a task, each implementation will require the addition of a set of dat-aclass configurations that inherit from those found in `offical.core.configdefinitions`. 

In addition to the configuration files, you should include a method named `experiment` that predefines all the configuration parameters and serves as a default model state if agiven parameter is not in the operating configuration file. This will allow configurationfiles to remain concise while also preserving the modelâ€™s essential functionality. 

The configurations and the Tasks are designed to come together into an operational model that can be manually configured via the input of a model configuration, or automatically configured using the trainer and a configuration file. Given that the model operatesusing this dual functionality, the task will not have any class parameters other than `self.taskconfig` used to hold the input configuration dataclasses.
